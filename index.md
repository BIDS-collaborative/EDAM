The information in the table is based on the completeness estimate of the [Meyer research](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150907/ncomms9221/full/ncomms9221.html).  
The estimate is a function of island area and island distance.  

NOTE: The data being analyzed currently only takes into consideration 110 sq km around the center  
coordinate of the island

*Total number of species in 110 sq km area according to unnamed experts  
** Number of records found using Effechecka. Discrepancies may occur due to area selection parameters.
