Ecostations Data Access Monitor: Classification of Invasive Species

## Project Information

With the goal of understanding and modeling ecosystems, we are examining characteristics of invasive species,
which have a large impact in ecosystems and on other species.

We want to develop a data driven method of identifying invasive species by identifying general characteristics
that are correlated with invasive species. 
In addition, we propose a clustering method based on these characteristics to simplify the manual classification
process of invasive species. 

We have analyzed a dataset of Pacific plants (PIER) and developed a webtool to analyze user input data.

## Origins

This project originated at a meeting with Neil Davies (Moorea IDEA, BIDS), Jorrit Poelen (GloBI) and Charlotte Cabasse (BIDS) at BIDS on Aug 5, 2015.
