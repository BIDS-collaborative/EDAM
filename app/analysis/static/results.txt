By filtering the data to remove missing information, we had a dataset of 962 samples and 18 features. We split the dataset 80:20 into training and validation sets. 

We trained classification on the training data and predicted on the training and validation data. Depending on the random split of training and validation sets, the prediction accuracy varied a bit. Using the Logistic Regression model, the prediction accuracy was around 75% for both the training and validation sets. With the Random Forest model, the training accuracy was around 85% and the test accuracy was around 75%. Based on these results, Random Forest has more overfitting but potentially has a better prediction accuracy. As seen in the confusion matrix, the classification model leans towards non-invasive. This can be attributed to data bias since a large number of samples are non-invasive.

The top 3 most important features from the Random Forest model accounted for about 30% of the total data variance. By training a model on just these 3 features, all 4 prediction accuracies ended up at around 75%. Similarly, we used PCA to reduce the 18 features to just 3 features, which accounted for 50% of the total variance and resulted in the same prediction accuracies as the full feature set. Based on these two results, the significant features for classification of invasive species are reproduction, dispersal, and naturalization.
