With the goal of understanding the challenges of classifying invasive species, we analyzed and tested classification models on the PIER Pacific plant dataset. Using a dataset of invasive plants, we trained machine learning models to classify the invasiveness of the PIER dataset plants. We first cleaned the data to remove plants missing too many features and only keeping features that are present in most of the samples and that can be easily attained. With the reduced dataset, we divided the samples into training and validation sets and trained Random Forest and Logistic Regression models. In addition, we used PCA to try to reduce the size of the feature space to better visualize the classification results.
