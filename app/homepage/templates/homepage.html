      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h4>Environmental Data Access Monitor (EDAM) is a part of an initiative to model ecosystems including food webs, species lists, and other interactions. The goal of EDAM is to measure how much biodiversity data is available for a certain ecosystem. To begin to quantify this metric, we have to better understand the factors affecting ecosystems.
      <br><br>
      Invasive species are one such factor, heavily impacting the presence of native species. However, there is currently no easy way to identify invasive species aside from manually classifying each species in an environment. Ecologists have plenty of species data but no way to use it to classify invasive species. We propose a method to use machine learning models to identify features that can define invasive species. A data driven method for classification would speed up the process significantly and remove the bottleneck of requiring expert analysis.
