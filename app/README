EDAM: Classification of Invasive Species

This web app is designed to showcase our analysis of the Pacific plants dataset
as well as allow for the analysis of user input data. The page is written with
Django in the backend with d3.js for visualization.

The Django project is divided into 3 apps: /homepage/, /analysis/, and /webtool/
in the respective folders. 

The /static/ folder contains page wide css and js files.
The /documents/ folder contains uploaded files.
The /app/ folder contains app setup scripts including root url routing.

Each app contains a views.py file that handles the backend logic as well as
a urls.py file that handles routing within the app.
The app/static/ folder in each app contains the css and js files and the 
app/templates/ folder contains the html.

Additional implementation details are in the comments in each file
