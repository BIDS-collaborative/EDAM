# EDAM: Classification of Invasive Species

This web app is designed to showcase our analysis of the Pacific plants dataset
as well as allow for the analysis of user input data. The page is written with
Django in the backend with d3.js for visualization.

# Local Machine Setup
1. clone the repo
2. set up a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda
3. activate the virtual environment
4. install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. navigate to `app/`
6. run the server using `python manage.py runserver`

The Django project is divided into 3 apps: /homepage/, /analysis/, and /webtool/
in the respective folders. 

The /static/ folder contains page wide css and js files.
The /documents/ folder contains uploaded files.
The /app/ folder contains app setup scripts including root url routing.

Each app contains a views.py file that handles the backend logic as well as
a urls.py file that handles routing within the app.
The app/static/ folder in each app contains the css and js files and the 
app/templates/ folder contains the html.

Additional implementation details are in the comments in each file


IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Django renders HTML by default through the index() function in each views.py file.
- File upload is handled in the webtool/views.py index() function when the form submitted.
These files are stored in the documents/ folder via form.save() and the ModelForm.
- d3 visualization functions are in the /static/d3 files. These include d3-axis.js, 
d3matrix.js, d3tips.js, and global_js.js
